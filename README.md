# Web AIS Viewer

This is a demonstration of using the Web [Serial API](https://wicg.github.io/serial/)
to connect to a AIS receiver, such as the dAISy or dAISy 2+ receivers from https://wegmatt.com/.

It uses the [OpenLayers API](https://openlayers.org/) to draw the locations of nearby vessels on
a map.
